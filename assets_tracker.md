# VEXEA Assets & Sounds Tracker

> [!WARNING]
> **CRITICAL REPOSITORY RULE (DISCLAIMER):**
> This Asset Tracker was explicitly created and added to the workspace to **strictly forbid** the direct uploading of massive `.glb` files, textures, audio, or other heavy binary assets to this git repository. Large media files **do not belong in this codebase repository**.
> All heavy assets MUST be hosted remotely (such as in external release packages or a CDN) and dynamically retrieved by the client loading sequence, rather than being committed to the git repository. Under no circumstances should AI coding assistants upload or generate large GLB or binary assets in the workspace.

This document tracks all the 3D models, textures, environment maps, and audio assets for **VEXEA**, separating them by category and noting their preservation and remote loading state.

## 1. 3D Models & Game Assets (`/` Root & Image)

The following assets have been completely cleaned out of the direct workspace files to stay strictly under the 50MB storage and client memory budget. They are pulled dynamically during the loading sequence from GitHub Releases or from high-performance local IndexedDB storage.

## 2. PBR Environmental Textures (`/client/public/textures/`)

The full high-fidelity PBR textures folder has been removed from on-disk storage to lighten the bundle size, dynamically compiled into blobs and cached instantly via IndexedDB in the client browser's memory sandbox.

## 3. High-Fidelity Positional Audio MP3s (`/client/public/audio/`)

All audio files have been uploaded to GitHub Releases and are seamlessly fetched and compiled into locally-caching blobs in IndexedDB. Audio loading has been decoupled from standard paths, keeping the application fast and avoiding compilation stutter.
